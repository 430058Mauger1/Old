### Typography

I will be using Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif in that order of priority. I will be using Arial because it is easy to read, versatile because of the various weights it has, and because it is a web safe font meaning it comes pre installed on machines. Helvetica is the second priority because it is similar to Arial, It is easy to read and versatile, and it is a web safe font. Sans-serif also has the same advantages to Areal and Helvetica.
