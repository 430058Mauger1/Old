I felt like this colour choice was a good choice because blue is considered

### Typography

I will be using Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif in that order of priority. I will be using Arial because it is easy to read, versatile because of the various weights it has, making it more accessible, meeting requirements, and because it is a web safe font meaning it comes pre installed on machines. Helvetica is the second priority because it is similar to Arial, It is easy to read and versatile, and it is a web safe font. Sans-serif also has the same advantages to Areal and Helvetica.

## Storyboards

#### C

#### D

#### E

All text will use the Arial font and should it not be available the Helvetica, or sans-serif fonts.

I decided to go with design two for my website because for the first design I would have had to create a separate page for the staff according to client requirements.
