I felt like this colour choice was a good choice because blue is considered

### Typography

I will be using Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif in that order of priority. I will be using Arial because it is easy to read, versatile because of the various weights it has, making it more accessible, meeting requirements, and because it is a web safe font meaning it comes pre installed on machines. Helvetica is the second priority because it is similar to Arial, It is easy to read and versatile, and it is a web safe font. Sans-serif also has the same advantages to Areal and Helvetica.

## Storyboards

### Company Profile Design

#### A Bootstrap Navbar

+ Will have the companies name, an about us link and a search bar and button.
+ #092833
+ Width 100% Height 56 pixels
+ White text, weight 700
+ Bootstraps navbar automatically adjusts its size and layout for smaller screens.

#### B Bootstrap grid column

+ Size: At and above the bootstrap breakpoint xl it is 8 of 12 columns in width, when it goes below xl it is 12 columns in width.
+ #5F7D89
+ white text, heading 1 use default weights and sizes.
+ Height 100%
+ Sticks to the top

#### C Bootstrap grid column

+ Size: At and above the bootstrap breakpoint xl it is 4 of 12 columns in width, when it goes below xl it is 12 columns in width.
+ #3F6270
+ white text, heading 1 use default weights and sizes.
+ Height 100%

#### D Text

+ white text, default heading weights and sizes. Paragraphs and list items text changes size depending on screen size, if the screen is 1200px of below the text is 14px, if it is above that it is 17px.

#### E Text

+ white text, default heading weights and sizes. Paragraphs and list items text changes size depending on screen size, if the screen is 1200px of below the text is 14px, if it is above that it is 17px.

All text will be in the Arial font and should it not be available the Helvetica, or sans-serif fonts.

I decided to go with design two for my website because for the first design I would have had to create a separate page for the staff according to client requirements. I also like this design because the added navigation capabilities like the search bar, which would make the site easier to navigate.

### Join us/Job Spec Page Alternative Design

In the alternative design I changed the job specification section to a carousel because otherwise there would need to be multiple different pages if there were more then one job available, this helps the code be more maintainable by reducing the amount of code.
